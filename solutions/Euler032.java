/* We shall say that an N-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to N exactly once; for 
 * example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
 * 
 * The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and 
 * product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
 * 
 * Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through N
 * pandigital.
 * 
 * HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.
 * 
 * INPUT: integer N, 4 <= N <= 9*/
