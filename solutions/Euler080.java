/* It is well known that if the square root of a natural number is not an integer, then it is irrational.
 * The decimal expansion of such square roots is infinite without any repeating pattern at all.
 *
 * The square root of two is 1.41421356237309504880..., and the digital sum of the first one hundred 
 * decimal digits is 475.
 *
 * For the first N natural numbers, find the total of the digital sums of the first  digits for all the 
 * irrational square roots x such that x <= N. 
 *
 * INPUTS: either 1 <= N <= 1000 and 1 <= P <= 1000, or 1 <= N <= 100 and 1 <= P <= 10000 */
