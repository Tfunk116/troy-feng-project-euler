/* It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:
 *
 * 4+1
 * 3+2
 * 3+1+1
 * 2+2+1
 * 2+1+1+1
 * 1+1+1+1+1
 *
 * How many different ways can  be written as a sum of at least two positive integers?
 *
 * As answer can be large, print % (10^9+7).
 *
 * INPUTS: 1 <= T <= 100, 2 <= N <= 1000 */
