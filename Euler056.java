/* A googol 10^100 is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros. 100^100 is almost unimaginably 
 * large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is 
 * only 1.
 * 
 * Considering natural numbers of the form, a^b, where a,b < N, what is the maximum digital sum?
 *
 * INPUTS: 5 <= N <= 200
 * Sample output: N=5 -> 13, as 4^4 = 256, and 2+5+6=13 is the maximal digital sum in that range. */
