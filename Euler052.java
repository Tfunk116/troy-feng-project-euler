/* -------- UNSOLVED -------- */

/* It can be seen that the number, 125874, and its double, 251748, contain exactly the same digits, but 
 * in a different order.
 * 
 * Given N, find all the positive integers, x <= N, such that x, 2x, ..., Kx contain the same digits. 
 * 
 * INPUTS: 125875 <= N <= 2000000, 2 <= K <= 6, space-separated N K
 * OUTPUT: all the K multiples. If greater than one x, print each in a new line.
 * 
 * Note 1: It is guaranteed a solution exists.
 * Note 2: You should not consider solutions with leading 0's. */
