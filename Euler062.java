/* The cube, 41063625=345^3, can be permuted to produce two other cubes: 56623104=384^3 and 66430125=405^3.
 * 
 * In fact, 41063625 is the smallest cube such that exactly three permutations of its digits are also cubes
 *
 * You are given N, find the smallest cube for which exactly K permutations of its digits are the cube of 
 * some number which is < N. If there are multiple sets, print the minimal element of each in sorted order.
 *
 * INPUTS: 1000 <= N <= 10^6, 3 <= K <= 49, space separated N K */
