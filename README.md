Project Euler ([HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges))

My solutions to the HackerRank versions of the Project Euler competition. Problem descriptions as found on HackerRank are included as comments in top lines of files. My thoughts and approach are commented as well.

Although they've been around for quite a while now, Project Euler questions are still really cool exercises in numerical computation, number theory, and much more. They can be (for the most part) solved by hand with some clever mathematical acrobatics, but the HackerRank ProjectEuler+ problems feature modifications to problem inputs that usually necessitate both the aforementioned math tricks, AND correct use and implementation of data structures and algorithms.

These problems are the type that one could be stuck for weeks and even months on. So even though it's a live competition, I have posted my solutions a) because my thoughts/approach comments, while brief, may provide a decent hint to those who are stuck and b) because one would be missing out on some neat problems if they copy/pasted!
