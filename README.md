My solutions to the HackerRank versions of the Project Euler competition. Problem descriptions as found on HackerRank are included as comments in top lines of files. My thoughts and approach are commented as well.

Although they've been around for quite a while now, Project Euler questions are still really cool exercises in numerical computation, number theory, and much more. They can be (for the most part) solved by hand with some clever mathematical acrobatics, but the HackerRank ProjectEuler+ versions of the problems feature modifications to problem inputs that make the problems pretty unsolvable without both the aforementioned math tricks, AND correct use and implementation of data structures and algorithms.
